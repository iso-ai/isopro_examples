# Adversarial Simulation

The Adversarial Simulation module in isopro allows you to test the robustness of AI models against various types of attacks.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the Adversarial Simulation module:

```python
from isopro.adversarial_simulation import AdversarialSimulator, AdversarialEnvironment
from isopro.agents.ai_agent import AI_Agent

class YourAIAgent(AI_Agent):
    def run(self, input_data):
        # Your AI model logic here
        pass

# Set up the environment
adv_env = AdversarialEnvironment(
    agent_wrapper=YourAIAgent("Your Agent"),
    num_adversarial_agents=2,
    attack_types=["textbugger", "deepwordbug"],
    attack_targets=["input", "output"]
)

# Create and run the simulator
simulator = AdversarialSimulator(adv_env)
input_data = ["What is the capital of France?", "How does photosynthesis work?"]
results = simulator.run_simulation(input_data, num_steps=1)
```
